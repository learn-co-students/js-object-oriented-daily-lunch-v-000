// Neighborhood class:
// new Neighborhood() - initialized with name. It returns an object that has attributes of id and name
// deliveries() - returns a list of all deliveries placed in a neighborhood
// customers() - returns all of the customers that live in a particular neighborhood
// meals() - returns a unique list of meals that have been ordered in a particular neighborhood (you might want to do this one last)

// Customer class:
// new Customer() — should expect to be initialized with a name and a neighborhoodId. It returns an object that has attributes of id, neighborhoodId, and name.
// deliveries() — returns all of the deliveries that customer has received
// meals() - returns all meals that a customer has ordered
// totalSpent() - returns the total amount that the customer has spent on food.

// Meal class:
// new Meal() — initialized with title and price. It returns an object that has attributes of title, price, and id. Meal Ids should automatically increment.
// deliveries() - returns all of the deliveries associated with a particular meal.
// customers() - returns all of the customers who have had the meal delivered. Be careful not to return the same customer twice if they have ordered this meal multiple times.
// byPrice() - A class method that orders all meal instances by their price in descending order. Use the static keyword to write a class method.

// Delivery class:
// new Delivery() — initialized with mealId, neighborhoodId, and customerId. It returns an object that has attributes of mealId, neighborhoodId, customerId, and id
// meal() - returns the meal associated with a particular delivery
// customer() - returns the customer associated with a particular delivery
// neighborhood() - returns the neighborhood associated with a particular delivery
